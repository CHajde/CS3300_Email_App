Integration Tests with Selenium WebDriver
Integration tests will check how different parts of your application work together from a user's perspective. Here are some suggestions:

1. Test User Registration Flow
Objective: Test that a new user can register through the UI, is redirected to the login page, and can log in with the new credentials.
2. Test Login and Logout
Objective: Test that a user can log in using valid credentials and can log out. Verify that after logging out, the user is redirected to the login page and does not have access to protected pages.
3. Test Create and View Reminder
Objective: Test that a logged-in user can create a new reminder and then see it listed in their reminders. This verifies the creation and retrieval processes.
4. Test Edit and Delete Reminder
Objective: Test that a user can edit an existing reminder and see the changes reflected. Also, test that a reminder can be deleted and then no longer appears in the list.


Run tests with: python manage.py test --verbosity 2
